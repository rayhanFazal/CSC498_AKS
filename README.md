# CSC498_AKS
This is my project implementation for CSC498 at UTM. My project topic is showing that the AKS Primality Test is in P. So this repository contains my implementation of the AKS algorithm in Python, which is aks.py

Note: log base 2 is used is used in this implementation.

Usage: python3 aks.py n
(n must be a positive integer greater than 1)

If you want to see the runtime of the algorithm, use the "time" command. Example:
time python3 aks.py 107
