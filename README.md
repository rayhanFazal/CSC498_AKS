# CSC498_AKS
This is my project implementation for CSC498 at UTM. My project topic is showing that the AKS Primality Test is in P. So this repository contains my implementation of the AKS algorithm in Python, which is aks.py

Note: log base 2 is used is used in this implementation.

Usage: TODO

TODO: Maybe consider making a script that times the runtime of aks on a given number, or a list of numbers. (Can use time command for this)
